    <p>         Stark Industries was founded by Howard Stark in 1939, a great pioneer in different types of technology and
        constantly assisted the United States Armed Forces with different and innovative weapons, helping the government
        to develop the Project Rebirth in the 1940s.

        Under the leadership of Howard Stark, Stark Industries also started the Stark Expo, also known as the World
        Exposition of Tomorrow, an exposition located in New York City, bringing together great minds and showcasing new
        technology.[2]

        During the 1950s and early 1960s, Stark created an Arc Reactor along with Anton Vanko,[3] a source which
        provided free, pure and efficient energy for Stark Industries' main plant.[4] In the 1980s, they developed
        surveillance drones.[5]
