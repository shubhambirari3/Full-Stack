


 1. What is Python, and what are its key features?

How to answer:

* Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
* Mention key features such as:
  * Easy to Read and Write : Python code is often described as close to English-like syntax.
  * Interpreted : Python code is executed line by line, which can help with debugging.
  * Dynamically Typed : You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
  * Rich Standard Library : Provides a wide range of modules and functionalities.
  * Community and Ecosystem : Huge community support, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, etc.
* Emphasize that these features make Python suitable for diverse domains such as web development, data science, scripting, automation, AI, and more.



 2. Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.

How to answer:

* Mutability : Lists are mutable (you can change them after creation), whereas tuples are immutable (values cannot be changed).
* Syntax :
* Lists use square brackets: `[ ]`
* Tuples use parentheses: `( )`
* Use Cases :
* Use lists when you need a collection of items that may change.
* Use tuples for fixed collections of items or when immutability is required.
* Performance :
* Tuples can be slightly more memory-efficient and faster to iterate over due to immutability.



 3. What is the difference between `append()`, `extend()`, and `+` operator when dealing with lists?

How to answer:

* `append(item)` : Adds a single element to the end of the list.


  my_list = [1, 2]
  my_list.append([3, 4])  # Result: [1, 2, [3, 4]]


* `extend(iterable)` : Extends a list by appending elements from the iterable (like another list) to the end of the current list.


  my_list = [1, 2]
  my_list.extend([3, 4])  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]


* `+ operator` : Concatenates two lists and returns a new list. It does not modify the original lists.


  list1 = [1, 2]
  list2 = [3, 4]
  new_list = list1 + list2  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]




 4. How are *  and kwargs used in Python functions?

How to answer:

* `*args` (non-keyword arguments) allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function:
  
  def example(*args):
      for arg in args:
          print(arg)
  example(1, 2, 3)  # prints 1, 2, 3
  
* `kwargs` (keyword arguments) allows you to pass a variable number of named arguments (like a dictionary) to a function:
  
  def example(kwargs):
      for key, value in kwargs.items():
          print(f"{key} = {value}")
  example(a=1, b=2, c=3)  # prints a=1, b=2, c=3
  
* Emphasize that these features make functions more flexible and can handle dynamic argument lists.



 5. What is a Python lambda function, and when would you use it?

How to answer:

* Definition : A lambda function is an anonymous, inline function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but has only one expression.
* Syntax :


  lambda arguments: expression


* Example :


  double = lambda x: x * 2
  print(double(5))  # Output: 10


* Use cases :
* When you need a small, throwaway function for concise tasks, such as in functional programming contexts (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
* Anonymous callbacks in GUI or event handling.
* Whenever a one-liner function will improve clarity and reduce clutter in your code.



 6. What is a list comprehension in Python? Give an example.

How to answer:

* Definition : A list comprehension provides a concise way to create lists by using an expression followed by a `for` clause, and optional `if` clauses.
* Syntax :


  [expression for item in iterable if condition]


* Example :


  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  squares = [x*x for x in numbers]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  even_squares = [x*x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # [4, 16]


* Discuss how list comprehensions are often more readable and Pythonic compared to traditional loops for generating lists.



 7. What is the difference between `range()` and `xrange()` (in Python 2) or how does `range()` work in Python 3?

How to answer (depends on Python version):

* In Python 2:
  * `range(n)` : Returns a list containing numbers from 0 to n-1. Consumes memory proportional to n.
  * `xrange(n)` : Returns an xrange object which generates numbers on the fly and uses constant memory.
* In Python 3:
  * `range(n)` behaves like Python 2’s `xrange()`. It creates a range object that is an iterable, not a list, and is memory-efficient.

Mention that in modern Python 3 code, `range()` is lazy and memory-friendly by default.



 8. What are decorators in Python, and how do you use them?

How to answer:

* Definition : A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of a function (or class) without changing its source code.
* Syntax :


  def decorator_function(original_function):
      def wrapper(*args, kwargs):
          # Code before
          result = original_function(*args, kwargs)
          # Code after
          return result
      return wrapper

  @decorator_function
  def some_function():
      pass


* Use cases :
* Logging
* Authentication
* Caching / memoization
* Pre- and post-execution processing (e.g., timing functions)



 9. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?

How to answer:

* Shallow Copy :
* Creates a new object but inserts references to the objects found in the original.
* In Python, you can perform a shallow copy using the `copy()` method on lists or the `copy` module’s `copy()` function.
* If the original contains mutable objects (like lists), changes to those sub-objects will be reflected in the copy.
* Deep Copy :
* Creates a completely new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.
* In Python, you can perform a deep copy using the `copy` module’s `deepcopy()` function.
* Modifications in the copied object do not affect the original.



 10. How does Python manage memory and what is garbage collection in Python?

How to answer:

* Python uses reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector to manage memory.
* Reference counting : Each object keeps track of how many references point to it. When this count goes to zero, the memory is freed.
* The garbage collector specifically handles circular references (objects referencing each other).
* Memory management is largely automatic, so programmers don’t usually manage memory manually (like in C/C++).



 11. Explain the concept of virtual environments in Python.

How to answer:

* Virtual environments isolate your Python projects so that each project has its own dependencies, regardless of what other projects have installed.
* Allows different versions of packages or libraries to coexist on the same machine without conflicts.
* Tools like `venv` (built-in module), `virtualenv`, `conda`, and others create isolated environments.

Example:

bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
myenv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)




 12. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?

How to answer:

* Definition : The Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.
* Implication : While it simplifies memory management, it means that multi-threaded Python programs do not necessarily run CPU-bound tasks in parallel.
* Workarounds :
* Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks, as each process has its own Python interpreter.
* Use asyncio or multi-threading for I/O-bound tasks where the GIL impact is less noticeable.
* In many I/O-intensive programs, threads can still be beneficial, but for CPU-bound tasks, `multiprocessing` is often used.



 13. What are generators, and how do they differ from normal functions?

How to answer:

* Definition : Generators are functions that use the `yield` keyword to return an iterator. They allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire data set in memory at once.
* Differences :
* Normal functions use `return`, which terminates the function.
* Generator functions use `yield`, which pauses and resumes the function’s state between calls.
* Advantages :
* Memory Efficiency : Generate items on the fly.
* Lazy Evaluation : Produces items only when requested, which can improve performance for large data sets.

Example:


def my_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i*i

gen = my_generator(3)  # a generator that yields 0, 1, 4




 14. What is the difference between `==` and `is` in Python?

How to answer:

* `==` (Equality) : Compares the values of two objects. Returns `True` if their values are the same.
* `is` (Identity) : Compares whether two variables point to the same object in memory.
* Example :


  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = [1, 2, 3]
  print(a == b)  # True (Same values)
  print(a is b)  # False (Different objects in memory)

  c = a
  print(c is a)  # True (Same reference)




 15. Explain exception handling in Python. How do you handle exceptions?

How to answer:

* Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
* Basic syntax:
  
  try:
      # Code that might raise an exception
  except SomeException as e:
      # Handle the exception
  else:
      # Execute if no exception was raised
  finally:
      # Always execute, regardless of exceptions
  
* `raise` is used to explicitly raise an exception.
* Why? : Prevent programs from crashing, provide meaningful error messages, and handle specific issues gracefully.
