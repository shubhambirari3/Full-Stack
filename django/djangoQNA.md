# HTTP Methods: GET and POST

## What is HTTP?
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.
- It is a protocol that defines how requests and responses are exchanged between a client (e.g., browser) and a server.
- **HTTP Methods** specify the type of action to be performed on a resource (e.g., fetching, creating, updating, or deleting).

## HTTP Methods: GET vs. POST

### 1. GET Method

#### What is GET?
- The GET method is used to **retrieve data** from the server.
- Data is sent as part of the **URL** in the form of query parameters.

#### Characteristics of GET
- **Visible Data**:
  - Data is appended to the URL, making it visible in the address bar.
- **Limited Data Size**:
  - URL length is limited (typically around 2000 characters).
- **Idempotent**:
  - Multiple GET requests for the same resource do not change the server's state (they only retrieve data).
- **Cacheable**:
  - Responses to GET requests can be cached by browsers or proxies for faster retrieval.

#### When to Use GET
- Fetching or displaying data without making any changes to the server or database.
- **Examples**:
  - Searching for items: `/search?q=django`
  - Viewing a task's details: `/tasks/1/`

### 2. POST Method

#### What is POST?
- The POST method is used to **send data** to the server to create or update resources.
- Data is included in the **body of the request**, not the URL.

#### Characteristics of POST
- **Secure Data Transmission**:
  - Data is not visible in the URL, making it more secure than GET for sensitive information.
- **No Data Size Limit**:
  - Can handle larger amounts of data, such as file uploads.
- **Not Idempotent**:
  - Each POST request changes the server's state (e.g., creating a new database record).
- **Cannot Be Cached**:
  - POST responses are not typically cached.

#### When to Use POST
- When sending data that changes the state of the server or database.
- **Examples**:
  - Submitting a form to create a new task: `/create/`
  - Updating a task's details: `/tasks/1/update/`

### Comparison of GET and POST

| Feature                | GET                              | POST                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Retrieve data                   | Send data to the server          |
| **Data in URL**        | Yes (as query parameters)       | No                              |
| **Data Size**          | Limited                         | Unlimited                       |
| **Idempotent**         | Yes                             | No                              |
| **Cacheable**          | Yes                             | Typically no                    |
| **Visibility**         | Data is visible in URL          | Data is hidden in request body  |
| **Usage Examples**     | Search, display content         | Form submission, database update|

## Examples in Django

### GET Example
Fetching all tasks (`task_list` view):
```python
def task_list(request):
    tasks = Task.objects.all()  # Fetch all tasks
    return render(request, 'todo_app/task_list.html', {'tasks': tasks})

#post example
def task_create(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.POST.get('title')
        description = request.POST.get('description')
        Task.objects.create(title=title, description=description)
        return redirect('task_list')
    return render(request, 'todo_app/task_create.html')

    When to Use GET vs. POST

Use GET When:
You need to retrieve information without modifying server-side data.
The operation is idempotent (does not change the server's state).
You want URLs to be bookmarkable or shareable.
Data being sent is small, non-sensitive, or not critical.

Use POST When:
You need to send data to the server to create, update, or delete a resource.
The operation changes the server's state (e.g., database modification).
You are working with sensitive data (e.g., login credentials).
You need to send large amounts of data (e.g., file uploads or detailed form submissions).



# HTTP Methods: PUT, PATCH, and ALL

---

## 1. PUT Method

### What is PUT?
- The **PUT** method is used to **update a resource completely** on the server.
- If the resource does not exist, it **may create a new resource** depending on the implementation.
- It replaces the **entire resource** with the data provided in the request body.

### Characteristics of PUT
- **Full Update**:
  - All fields of the resource are updated. If some fields are omitted in the request, their values are reset (e.g., to default or `null`).
- **Idempotent**:
  - Repeated PUT requests with the same data yield the same result on the server.

### When to Use PUT
- When you need to completely replace an existing resource.
- **Example**:
  - Updating a task with ID `1`:
    - Request: `PUT /tasks/1/`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
          "title": "Updated Task",
          "description": "Updated Description",
          "is_completed": true
      }
      ```

---

## 2. PATCH Method

### What is PATCH?
- The **PATCH** method is used to **partially update a resource** on the server.
- Unlike PUT, it updates only the fields specified in the request, leaving other fields unchanged.

### Characteristics of PATCH
- **Partial Update**:
  - Only the fields included in the request body are updated.
- **Not Idempotent in All Cases**:
  - If the server logic modifies additional fields during PATCH, multiple identical requests may result in different outcomes.

### When to Use PATCH
- When you need to update only specific fields of a resource without altering the others.
- **Example**:
  - Partially updating a task with ID `1`:
    - Request: `PATCH /tasks/1/`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
          "is_completed": true
      }
      ```

## 3. ALL Method in Django

### What is ALL?
- The `ALL` method is not an HTTP method itself but refers to **handling multiple HTTP methods** in a single view function.
- In Django, the `ALL` methods can be supported using conditional checks for `request.method` or by using class-based views (CBVs).

### Example of Handling ALL Methods in a Django View
```python
def task_view(request, task_id=None):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        if task_id:
            task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id)  # Fetch specific task
            return JsonResponse({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title})  # Example response
        else:
            tasks = Task.objects.all()  # Fetch all tasks
            return JsonResponse(list(tasks.values()), safe=False)  # Example response

    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # Create a new task
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        task = Task.objects.create(title=data['title'], description=data['description'])
        return JsonResponse({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title}, status=201)

    elif request.method == 'PUT':
        # Full update of a task
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id)
        task.title = data['title']
        task.description = data['description']
        task.is_completed = data['is_completed']
        task.save()
        return JsonResponse({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title})

    elif request.method == 'PATCH':
        # Partial update of a task
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id)
        if 'title' in data:
            task.title = data['title']
        if 'is_completed' in data:
            task.is_completed = data['is_completed']
        task.save()
        return JsonResponse({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title})

    elif request.method == 'DELETE':
        # Delete a task
        task = get_object_or_404(Task, id=task_id)
        task.delete()
        return JsonResponse({'message': 'Task deleted'}, status=204)

    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Method not allowed'}, status=405)
